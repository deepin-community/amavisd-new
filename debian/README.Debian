amavisd-new for Debian
===========================================================

* It is a very good idea to read NEWS.Debian often, or to use
  apt-listchanges.

* The LDAP schema for amavisd-new is installed in 
  /etc/ldap/schema/amavis.schema.


Configuration layout
--------------------

Configuration is split into two directories, and processed in the order below:

Read-only configuration:  /usr/share/amavis/conf.d/
  10-debian_scripts:		Stuff you'd better not override
  20-package:			Packaging decisions, override at will

Read-write conffiles: /etc/amavis/conf.d/
  01-debian:			Rarely modified settings
  05-domain_id:			mydomain autodetection, local_domains config
  05-node_id:			myhostname autodetection
  15-av_scanners:		AV scanner interface configuration
  15-content_filter_mode:	Use this to re-enable spamassassin/av checks
  20-debian_defaults:		Commonly modified settings
  50-user:			Place your overrides here, if you want

If the package detects legacy config files, it renames them adding a
".disabled" extension, and the amavisd-new initscript will refuse to start the
service until these files with a ".disabled" extension are removed or renamed.
The legacy config files are /etc/amavis.conf and /etc/amavis/amavis.conf.


Sendmail Milter
---------------

Please see README.milter for Debian specific instructions on getting milter
support running with amavisd-new-milter.  We recommend you use the
dual-sendmail setup described in README.sendmail-dual, though.  DO notice that
there are *two* different sockets when using milter.


Permissions
-----------

In order to make amavisd-new default installation safer the permissions on some
directories have been thightend - namely these are:

/var/lib/amavis
/var/lib/amavis/db
/var/lib/amavis/tmp
/var/lib/amavis/virusmails

Be aware that this can cause problems with other software which may need access
to some of these directories to do their work, for example web-based quarantine
management tools. To make them work you will need to change the ownership of
the directory /var/lib/amavis/virusmails to amavis.www-data and also adjust its
permissions to 0770 so that the webserver is able to access and modify the
quarantined mails (you can achieve this with the "dpkg-statoverride" command
using the optional flags "--force" and "--update"). Other programs which may
also face such issues are unprivileged command-line tools and daemonized virus
scanners (for specific solutions concerning them see below).


Antivirus and spam-checking
---------------------------

amavisd-new does not depend on any antivirus, so antivirus checking is not
enabled by default. It also does not depend on spamassassin, so spam checking
is not enabled by default. They are turned off in
/usr/share/amavis/conf.d/20-package. To enable them, edit
/etc/amavis/conf.d/15-content_filter_mode.

If you use clamav-daemon, add the clamav user to the amavis group by running
"adduser clamav amavis" as root. The preferred method for using other virus
scanners which run as a different unprivileged user is to change their primary
group to amavis (you can change this with "usermod -g").

If you use spamassassin with the Bayes database system, you should make sure
that the spamassassin configuration option "bayes_auto_expire 0" is set in
spamassassin configure files.  This disables the automatic expiration of tokens
which causes problems for amavisd-new when activated.  The amavisd-new package
includes cron jobs that take care of syncing and expiring the token database
frequently.

Quarantine Directory
--------------------

By default amavis saves banned mail (like virus or banned attachments) 
for later investigation in /var/lib/amavis/virusmail. You should keep an
eye on the directory and clean it up regularly. To prevent accidental loss
of legitimate mail, this isn't done by the package.

Debugging
---------

To debug amavis, run:
/etc/init.d/amavis debug
or
/etc/init.d/amavis debug-sa

amavisd-status
--------------

2.9.0-1 introduced support for the amavisd-status script. 
The amavisd-status script gets notified via zeromq about the 
current state of the amavis children and displays it. If you want 
to use this feature you have to install libzeromq-perl and enable
the amavis-mc service in /etc/default/amavis-mc

amavisd-snmp-subagent
---------------------

Amavis supports exporting status and statistical information 
via snmp. If you want to use this feature your snmpd needs to have
AgentX support enabled and tcp6 support via localhost (::1). 

"master          agentx"
and
"agentXSocket    tcp6:[::1]:705" 
should do the trick. 

You also have to enable the snmp-subagent service via
/etc/default/amavisd-snmp-subagent. 
The subagent can either use zeromq or bdb for fetching the data from amavis.
If you want to use zeromq the amavic-mc service has to be enabled via
/etc/default/amavis-mc and libzeromq-perl needs to be installed on your
system.

You can change the backend in /etc/default/amavisd-snmp-subagent.
