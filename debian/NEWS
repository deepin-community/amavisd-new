amavisd-new (1:2.11.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  To prevent sending out unsolicited bounces default
  for final_banned_destiny is now D_DISCARD
  D_DISCARD. That may - depending on your quarantine settings -
  lead to lost mails.
  The new default for final_spam_destiny is now D_PASS, so that
  spam mail only gets tagged and never dropped.
  Please remember that this is just an example configuration. Review 
  it carefully before using it in production.
